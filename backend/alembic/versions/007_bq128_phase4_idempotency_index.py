"""BQ-128 Phase 4: Partial unique index for message idempotency

Originally created to add a partial unique index on messages(session_id,
client_message_id). However, the messages table lives in vai_state.db
(legacy engine), NOT in vectoraiz.db (Alembic-managed). The index is now
created in _migrate_legacy_bq128() in app/core/database.py instead.

This migration is kept as a no-op to maintain the Alembic revision chain.

Revision ID: 007_bq128_phase4_idempotency_index
